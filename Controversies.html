<h2><b> Computers in the <a href= "https://www.arup.com/perspectives/publications/research/section/making-place-the-recalibration-of-work-life-and-place"> workplace</a> </b> </h2>
<h3>Computers in the workforce have both advantages and disadvantages. Some of the advantages include:</h3>
<ul>
     <li>Technology is so intertwined with workplace life that its advantages have crept into every aspect of how we do business. It’s an obvious observation, but what was once the stuff of science fiction has become totally unremarkable. Tech capabilities such as effortless videoconferencing, AI-powered logistics, and automated customer support tools would have seemed unfeasible just a few years ago—but today they’re commonplace. </li>
	 <li>Aside from the widely discussed vision and musculoskeletal problems, according to Communications Workers of America, there is an increased rate of heart-related disease in computer-based offices due to the intense pressure of having work constantly monitored via computer.</li>

<h2><b> Computers in <a href= "https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/ambpp.1974.17528442#:~:text=The%20computer%20has%20not%20reached%20its%20full%20potential,in%20formulating%20solutions%20to%20complex%20problems--notably%20strategic%20decisions.">decision making</a> </b> </h2>
<h3>Computers have become more prominent in the working industries. Various effects include:</h3>
<ul>
     <li>Automated decision-making is a process where a conclusion is made solely by a computer. It is often used in places where many decisions of the same type need to be made in quick succession. While automated decision-making excels at analyzing large datasets to detect patterns, computers are often considered objective and neutral compared with humans, whose biases can cloud judgments. However, there are concerns about the fairness of automated decision-making. For example, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) has warned about what it calls “huge gaps” in UK employment law over the use of artificial intelligence at work. The Social Security (Administration) Act was the first legislation allowing computers to automatically make important decisions with real impact on people’s lives.</li>
</ul>

<div class= "AI">
<h2><b> Controversies due to the use of <a href ="https://www.upgrad.com/blog/top-challenges-in-artificial-intelligence/" >Artificial Intelligence</a> in the industry</b> </h2>
<h3>One of the most polemic things used in the workfoce is without a doubt AI</h3>
<ul>
<li> Artificial intelligence (AI) is a controversial topic with detractors expressing concern about its potential existential threat to humanity. Critics worry that attempts at simulating human thinking may threaten human sentience and lead to catastrophic results. Immediate concerns include the risk of inherent racial and socioeconomic bias in machine-learning algorithms and the danger of increased automation leading to mass unemployment. Lack of transparency and susceptibility to inaccuracies and discriminatory outcomes are also concerns. AI presents ethical concerns in the areas of privacy and surveillance, bias and discrimination, and the role of human judgment. </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class= "Environmentals">
<h2><b> The venomous effects on the <a href = "https://sciencing.com/how-do-computers-pollute-the-environment-13660586.html">environments </a> due to the increasingly use of computers</b> </h2>
<h3> Computers are one of the most influential harms to the ambiance</h3>
<ul>
<li> Computers have a significant impact on the environment. The main impacts are believed to be significant energy use in the production and operation of computers and possible long-term health effects on workers, families, and neighboring communities due to chemical exposure and emissions from production stages such as microchip fabrication.

According to new research, global computing could be responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than air travel. The carbon footprint of computers is far higher than previously thought and will continue to rise significantly unless action is taken.

Environmental impact from desktop computing arises from three main lifecycle phases: manufacture, use, and disposal. Power consumption of several staff desktop and laptop combinations are broadly consistent with supplier data (calculated using an IT-specialized lifecycle assessment method)</li>
</ul>

<div class= "ethical">
<h2><b> Ethical issues prominent due to the use of computers</b> </h2>
<h3>These are the most paramount ethical issues:</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship" >Internet censorship</a> is a complex issue that affects the way people access information. It restricts too much information and it’s entirely possible that real information is blocked along with fake information, which opens up a large debate about what you should and shouldn’t restrict/access. Censoring the internet is not necessarily an easy task. It requires a constant effort by censors to monitor networks and websites, remove or flag problematic content or posts, or create (and maintain) an infrastructure that allows for easy monitoring of the internet and filtering of content.</li>
<li> <a href= "https://smallbusiness.chron.com/ethical-issues-employer-monitoring-internet-usage-12617.html#:~:text=Ethical%20Issues%20%26%20Employer%20Monitoring%20Internet%20Usage%201,...%203%20Company%20Rights%20...%204%20Considerations%20"> Computer monitoring</a> is a controversial topic that raises ethical issues. Some of the ethical issues that arise from computer monitoring include privacy and cybersecurity. Employers may monitor their employees’ internet usage to protect their interests while ensuring they don’t go so far that employees lose all sense of privacy in the workplace</li>
<li> Ethical issues related to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1609406918788203"> personal information analysis </a>are becoming increasingly important. The processing of personal data should be done with ethics in mind. The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is one of the regulations that should be considered when processing personal data. It is important to adhere to an individual’s wishes about how to use their data. Just as it’s considered stealing to take an item that doesn’t belong to you, it’s unlawful and unethical to collect someone’s personal data without their consent. There are several ethical challenges related to data privacy such as not knowing the individual’s wishes or the individual’s wishes contradicting regulatory requirements. Government authorities must monitor cybercrime and require organizations to handle private data securely.</li>
<li> Ethical issues surrounding <a href ="http://theteacher.info/index.php/computing-principles/1-5-legal-moral-ethical-and-cultural-issues/1-5-2-ethical-moral-and-cultural-issues/3227-piracy-and-offensive-communications">piracy and offensive communications </a> are a complex topic. Piracy is considered an ethical issue on cyberspace. It is the illegal copying of software, illegal access and interception, misuse of devices, computer-related forgery, fraud, offences related to child pornography, offences related to infringements of copyright and related rights. Regarding offensive communications, the internet provides a seemingly anonymous front for offensive communication2. In most cases involving malicious communications, there will be multiple offensive or threatening letters or telephone calls and therefore the police will usually charge the offender with an offence under Section 2 of the Protection from Harassment Act 19973.</li>
<li> The question of <a href= "https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2021/02/ethical-design-why-is-it-critical-for-ux-designers.php"> ethical design </a> is relevant for all products, and you can find examples of failures to meet this need across a diverse range of use cases and contexts. For example, a video of two Facebook employees using a soap dispenser in a company washroom went viral on Twitter. The footage revealed that when a white employee used the soap dispenser, he received the soap easily. But when a black employee put his hand under the sensor-driven soap dispenser, he got no soap at all—even after multiple attempts! The reason: the sensor wasn’t able to sense his hand! This is a typical example of how people’s racist biases can impact human-machine interactions if product developers and designers fail to recognize such possibilities.</li>
